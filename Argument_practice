1. Topic: increased levels of melatonin before birth lead to shyness during infancy and this shyness continues into later life

In this argument, the author claims that increased levels of melatonin before birth lead to shyness during infancy and this shyness continues into later life. To bolster his/her statement, the author cited the discoveries from a study on a group of 25 infants carried out thirteen years ago as well as its followed-up study conducted earlier this year. While seemingly plausible at first glance, the argument is in fact replete with holes, leaving its reliability questionable.

One important proof the author relies is the fact that the mothers of infants showing signs of mild distress may produce higher levels of melatonin when conceiving. However, the exact function of melatonin was unclear. The argument only vaguely mentioned that melatonin can affect some brain functions, but what exactly these functions are? Maybe it has good affects on the language zone of brains, or maybe it adversely affects functions related to judgment or movement. We just do not know. Unless the author provides detailed evidence indicating what functions melatonin specifically affects, we can not simply relate signs of distress with melatonin. Take one step back, even there is direct evidence showing the connection between distress with melatonin, the author seems to mistakenly equate distress with shyness. After all, the study he/she cited mentioned distress instead of shyness, and we know that these two concepts are not the same.

Additionally, the author attributes teenagers’ distress in the follow-up study to melatonin. Although this is entirely possible, it is not necessarily the case, and the author does not supply any evidence to confirm his/her assumption. Common sense informs us that many factors can play a role in affecting a teenager’s character, such as
